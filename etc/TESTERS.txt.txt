Instructions to run webcheckers program:

1.) Using the terminal, navigate to the root folder of the project
2.) Once in the right directory, use the command "mvn compile exec:java" to compile and run the program
	Note: the following command results in a build error, try entering the command "mvn clean".
3.) When the program is running, head over to your browser and enter your local address "http://localhost:4567/". When testing more than one 
    player, open up a second browser. If it's showing the same player as the last browser, try using a different browser for the other palyer,
    incognito also works.
